Covering the Corral
===================

The cows are so modest they want Farmer John to install covers
around the circular corral where they occasionally gather. The
corral has circumference C (1 <= C <= 1,000,000,000), and FJ can
choose from a set of M (1 <= M <= 100,000) covers that have fixed
starting points and sizes. At least one set of covers can surround
the entire corral.

Cover i can be installed at integer location x_i (distance from
starting point around corral) (0 <= x_i < C) and has integer length
l_i (1 <= l_i <= C).

FJ wants to minimize the number of segments he must install. What
is the minimum number of segments required to cover the entire
circumference of the corral?

Consider a corral of circumference 5, shown below as a pair of
connected line segments where both '0's are the same point on the
corral (as are both 1's, 2's, and 3's).

Three potential covering segments are available for installation:

           Start   Length
      i     x_i     l_i
      1      0       1 
      2      1       2 
      3      3       3 

        0   1   2   3   4   0   1   2   3  ... 
corral: +---+---+---+---+--:+---+---+---+- ...
        11111               1111
            22222222            22222222
                    333333333333
            |..................|

As shown, installing segments 2 and 3 cover an extent of (at least)
five units around the circumference. FJ has no trouble with the
overlap, so don't worry about that.
