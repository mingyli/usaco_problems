Slowing down
============

Every day each of Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows conveniently
numbered 1..N move from the barn to her private pasture. The pastures
are organized as a tree, with the barn being on pasture 1. Exactly
N-1 cow unidirectional paths connect the pastures; directly connected
pastures have exactly one path. Path i connects pastures A_i and
B_i (1 <= A_i <= N; 1 <= B_i <= N).

Cow i has a private pasture P_i (1 <= P_i <= N). The barn's small
door lets only one cow exit at a time; and the patient cows wait
until their predecessor arrives at her private pasture. First cow
1 exits and moves to pasture P_1. Then cow 2 exits and goes to
pasture P_2, and so on.

While cow i walks to P_i she might or might not pass through a
pasture that already contains an eating cow. When a cow is present
in a pasture, cow i walks slower than usual to prevent annoying her
friend.

Consider the following pasture network, where the number between
parentheses indicates the pastures' owner.

        1 (3)        
       / \
  (1) 4   3 (5)
     / \   
(2) 2   5 (4)

First, cow 1 walks to her pasture:

        1 (3)        
       / \
  [1] 4*  3 (5)
     / \   
(2) 2   5 (4)

When cow 2 moves to her pasture, she first passes into the barn's
pasture, pasture 1. Then she sneaks around cow 1 in pasture 4 before
arriving at her own pasture.

        1 (3)
       / \
  [1] 4*  3 (5)
     / \   
[2] 2*  5 (4)

Cow 3 doesn't get far at all -- she lounges in the barn's pasture, #1.

        1* [3]
       / \
  [1] 4*  3 (5)
     / \   
[2] 2*  5 (4)

Cow 4 must slow for pasture 1 and 4 on her way to pasture 5:

        1* [3]
       / \
  [1] 4*  3 (5)
     / \   
[2] 2*  5* [4]

Cow 5 slows for cow 3 in pasture 1 and then enters her own private pasture:

        1* [3]
       / \
  [1] 4*  3*[5]
     / \   
[2] 2*  5* [4]

FJ would like to know how many times each cow has to slow down.
