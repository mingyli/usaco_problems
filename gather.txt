Great Cow Gathering
===================

Bessie is planning the annual Great Cow Gathering for cows all
across the country and, of course, she would like to choose the
most convenient location for the gathering to take place.

Each cow lives in one of N (1 <= N <= 100,000) different barns
(conveniently numbered 1..N) which are connected by N-1 roads in
such a way that it is possible to get from any barn to any other
barn via the roads. Road i connects barns A_i and B_i (1 <= A_i <=
N; 1 <= B_i <= N) and has length L_i (1 <= L_i <= 1,000). The Great
Cow Gathering can be held at any one of these N barns. Moreover,
barn i has C_i (0 <= C_i <= 1,000) cows living in it.

When choosing the barn in which to hold the Cow Gathering, Bessie
wishes to maximize the convenience (which is to say minimize the
inconvenience) of the chosen location. The inconvenience of choosing
barn X for the gathering is the sum of the distances all of the
cows need to travel to reach barn X (i.e., if the distance from
barn i to barn X is 20, then the travel distance is C_i*20). Help
Bessie choose the most convenient location for the Great Cow
Gathering.

Consider a country with five barns with [various capacities] connected
by various roads of varying lengths. In this set of barns, neither
barn 3 nor barn 4 houses any cows.

Bessie can hold the Gathering in any of five barns; here is the
table of inconveniences calculated for each possible location:

  Gather      ----- Inconvenience ------
  Location    B1  B2  B3  B4  B5   Total
     1         0   3   0   0  14    17
     2         3   0   0   0  16    19
     3         1   2   0   0  12    15
     4         4   5   0   0   6    15
     5         7   8   0   0   0    15

If Bessie holds the gathering in barn 1, then the inconveniences
from each barn are:
      Barn 1     0 -- no travel time there!
      Barn 2     3 -- total travel distance is 2+1=3  x 1 cow = 3
      Barn 3     0 -- no cows there!
      Barn 4     0 -- no cows there!
      Barn 5    14 -- total travel distance is 3+3+1=7 x 2 cows = 14
So the total inconvenience is 17.

The best possible convenience is 15, achievable at by holding the
Gathering at barns 3, 4, or 5.
