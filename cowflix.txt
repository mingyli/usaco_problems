Going to the Movies
===================

Farmer John is taking some of his cows to the movies! While his 
truck has a limited capacity of C (100 <= C <= 5000) kilograms, he   
wants to take the cows that, in aggregate, weigh as much as possible
without exceeding the limit C.

Given N (1 <= N <= 16) cows and their respective weights W_i, determine   
the weight of the heaviest group of cows that FJ can take to the 
movies.
