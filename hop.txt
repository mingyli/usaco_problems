Cow Hopscotch
=============

The cows have reverted to their childhood and are playing a game similar 
to human hopscotch. Their hopscotch game features a line of N (3 <=
N <= 250,000) squares conveniently labeled 1..N that are chalked onto 
the grass.

Like any good game, this version of hopscotch has prizes!  Square i is 
labeled with some integer monetary value V_i (-2,000,000,000 <=
V_i <= 2,000,000,000). The cows play the game to see who can earn the 
most money.

The rules are fairly simple:

    * A cow starts at square "0" (located just before square 1; it
      has no monetary value).

    * She then executes a potentially empty sequence of jumps toward
      square N. Each square she lands on can be a maximum of K (2
      <= K <= N) squares from its predecessor square (i.e., from
      square 1, she can jump outbound to squares 2 or 3 if K==2).

    * Whenever she wishes, the cow turns around and jumps back
      towards square 0, stopping when she arrives there. In addition
      to the restrictions above (including the K limit), two
      additional restrictions apply:

      * She is not allowed to land on any square she touched on her
        outbound trip (except square 0, of course).

      * Except for square 0, the squares she lands on during the
	return trip must directly precede squares she landed on
	during the outbound trip (though she might make some larger
	leaps that skip potential return squares altogether).
      
She earns an amount of money equal to the sum of the monetary values
of all the squares she jumped on. Find the largest amount of cash
a cow can earn.

By way of example, consider this six-box cow-hopscotch course where
K has the value 3:

Square Num:    0      1      2      3      4      5      6
             +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+
             |///|--|   |--|   |--|   |--|   |--|   |--|   |
             +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+
     Value:    -      0      1      2     -3      4      5

One (optimal) sequence Bessie could jump (shown with respective
bracketed monetary values) is: 1[0], 3[2], 6[5], 5[4], 2[1], 0[0]
would yield a monetary total of 0+2+5+4+1+0=12.

If Bessie jumped a sequence beginning with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... then
she would be unable to return since she could not legally jump back
to an untouched square.
