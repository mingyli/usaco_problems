The Rock Game
=============

Before the cows head home for rest and recreation, Farmer John wants
them to get some intellectual stimulation by playing a game.

The game board comprises N (1 <= N <= 15) identical holes in the
ground, all of which are initially empty. A cow moves by either
covering exactly one hole with a rock, or uncovering exactly one
previously covered hole. The game state is defined by which holes
are covered with rocks and which aren't. The goal of the game is
for the cows to reach every possible game state exactly once and
then return to the state with all holes uncovered.

The cows have been having a tough time winning the game.  Below is
an example of one of their games:

       Holes
time   1  2  3 
-----------------
0      O  O  O  Initially all of the holes are empty
1      O  O  X  The cow covers hole 3
2      X  O  X  The cow covers hole 1
3      X  O  O  The cow uncovers hole 3
4      X  X  O  The cow covers hole 2
5      O  X  O  The cow uncovers hole 1
6      O  X  X  The cow covers hole 3
7      X  X  X  The cow covers hole 1

Now the cows are stuck! They must uncover one hole and no matter
which one they uncover they will reach a state they have already
reached. For example if they remove the rock from the second hole
they will reach the state (X O X) which they already visited at
time 2.

Below is an example of a valid solution for N=3 holes:

       Holes
time   1  2  3 
-----------------
0      O  O  O  Initial state: all of the holes are empty
1      O  X  O  The cow covers hole 2
2      O  X  X  The cow covers hole 3
3      O  O  X  The cow uncovers hole 2
4      X  O  X  The cow covers hole 1
5      X  X  X  The cow covers hole 2
6      X  X  O  The cow uncovers hole 3
7      X  O  O  The cow uncovers hole 2
8      O  O  O  The cow uncovers the 1st hole

which returns the game board to the start having, visited each state once.

The cows are tired of the game and want your help. Given N, create
a valid sequence of states that solves the game. If there are
multiple solutions return any one.

PROBLEM NAME: rocks

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N

SAMPLE INPUT (file rocks.in):

3

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..2^N+1: A string of length N containing only 'O' and 'X'
        (where O denotes a uncovered hole and X denotes a covered
        hole). The jth character in this line represents whether the
        jth hole is covered or uncovered in this state. The first and
        last lines must be all uncovered (all O).

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file rocks.out):

OOO
OXO
OXX
OOX
XOX
XXX
XXO
XOO
