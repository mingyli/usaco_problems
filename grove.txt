The Grove
=========

The pasture contains a small, contiguous grove of trees that has
no 'holes' in the middle of the it.  Bessie wonders: how far is it
to walk around that grove and get back to my starting position?
She's just sure there is a way to do it by going from her start
location to successive locations by walking horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally and counting each move as a single step. Just looking
at it, she doesn't think you could pass 'through' the grove on a
tricky diagonal. Your job is to calculate the minimum number of
steps she must take.

Happily, Bessie lives on a simple world where the pasture is
represented by a grid with R rows and C columns (1 <= R <= 50, 1
<= C <= 50). Here's a typical example where '.' is pasture (which
Bessie may traverse), 'X' is the grove of trees, '*' represents
Bessie's start and end position, and '+' marks one shortest path
she can walk to circumnavigate the grove (i.e., the answer):

...+...
..+X+..
.+XXX+.
..+XXX+
..+X..+
...+++*

The path shown is not the only possible shortest path; Bessie might
have taken a diagonal step from her start position and achieved a
similar length solution. Bessie is happy that she's starting 'outside'
the grove instead of in a sort of 'harbor' that could complicate
finding the best path.

PROBLEM NAME: grove

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: R and C

* Lines 2..R+1: Line i+1 describes row i with C characters (with no
        spaces between them).

SAMPLE INPUT (file grove.in):

6 7
.......
...X...
..XXX..
...XXX.
...X...
......*

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The single line contains a single integer which is the
        smallest number of steps required to circumnavigate the grove.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file grove.out):
